# ip-tools

The ip-tools package is a collection of command-line utilities that
perform arithmetic and other useful operations on IP addresses.

Currently, only IPv4 addresses are supported.

## ipagg

The ipagg utility reads a list of IPv4 addresses and ranges, coalesces
adjacent ranges and prints out a sorted, deduplicated list.
