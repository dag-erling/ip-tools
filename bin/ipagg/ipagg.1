.Nd Sort and coalesce IPv4 addresses and ranges
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fnsv
.Op Fl 1 | Fl 2 | Fl 3 | Fl 4
.Op Fl a Ar maxplen
.Op Fl i Ar minplen
.Op Ar addr Ns | Ns Ar range Ns | Ns Ar subnet ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sorts and coalesces IPv4 addresses and ranges specified files
on the command line, or from standard input if no arguments were
specified on the command line.
.Pp
Each argument can have one of three forms:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar a.b.c.d
The single IPv4 address
.Ar a.b.c.d .
.It Ar a.b.c.d Ns Ar - Ns Ar e.f.g.h
A range of addresses starting at
.Ar a.b.c.d
and ending at
.Ar e.f.g.h .
The start and end addresses do not need to be aligned to subnet
boundaries.
.It Ar a.b.c.d Ns / Ns Ar l
The subnet that starts at
.Ar a.b.c.d
with prefix length
.Ar l .
The start address must be correctly aligned for the given prefix
length.
.El
.Pp
Files are read and parsed one line at a time.
Each line may contain only one address, range or subnet.
Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash character
.Pq Dq #
are ignored.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl 1 | Fl 2 | Fl 3 | Fl 4
Granularity, in bits, of the internal representation of addresses and
subnets.
The default is 4.
Smaller values can significantly increase memory consumption.
.Pp
Note that this can result in
.Em deaggregation
of input ranges.
For instance, with any granularity larger than 1, a /23 subnet will be
represented as two consecutive /24 subnets.
.It Fl a Ar maxplen
Maximum prefix length, between 8 and 32.
Ranges with longer prefix lengths than the maximum (i.e. smaller
subnets) will be rounded up.
The default is 24.
.It Fl f
Print the result as a PCAP filter expression.
.It Fl i Ar minplen
Minimum prefix length, between 4 and 28.
Ranges with shorter prefix lengths than the minimum (i.e. larger
subnets) will be deaggregated.
The default is 8.
.It Fl n
Do not perform aggregation.
This can be used to simply sort a list of addresses or ranges.
.Pp
Note that deaggregation may still take place as described above.
.It Fl s
Omit the prefix length from the output when it is 32.
This has no effect if the
.It Fl f
option was specified.
.It Fl v
Print verbose information while constructing the tree.
